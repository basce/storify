The application/platform allows multiple Asian brands to discover content producers who produce relevant and authentic content on social media platforms and assign campaigns to them.

In order for each producer to display posts from their own feed to serve as  portfolio on the app and to authenticate that he or she is a  genuine owner of the account that he/she claim to own, we would like access/permission to verify that they are indeed owners of the account they would like to display posts from. As part of the showcase, we would also like to feature their level of engagement of the content they produce on Instagram (basic, public_content, comments, likes, follower_list)
